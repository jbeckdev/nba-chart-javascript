Dynamic Charts showing games and scores/winners and losers during the Rockets/Warriors playoff games


Eventually I'd like to be able to add functionality where the user can input two different teams and a year
and it will pull from score API's comparing the playoff runs. Need to study more on backend knowledge first.
